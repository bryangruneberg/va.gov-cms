## Problem Statement

***Example:*** *The problem is that the website is not loading properly on some devices. When users try to access the site on their phone, they are unable to load the page and are greeted with an error message instead. This is causing frustration among our users and we need to find a solution as soon as possible.*

## Recommendation

***Example:*** *One potential solution to this issue could be to optimize the website for mobile devices. This could involve ensuring that all page elements are properly scaled and aligned for smaller screens, and improving the website's overall performance on mobile devices. Additionally, we could also consider implementing responsive design techniques to make the website more user-friendly on mobile devices. These changes should help to improve the user experience and reduce the number of errors encountered when accessing the site on a mobile device.*

## Rationale

***Example:*** *Implementing this solution is necessary to ensure that our website remains accessible and user-friendly on mobile devices. An increasing number of users are accessing the internet on mobile devices, so it is crucial that our website is optimized for these devices. This will also help to improve the website's performance and reduce errors, resulting in a better overall user experience.*


## Other Options Considered

***Sample:*** *Another option that we considered was to create a separate mobile app for our website. This would allow us to tailor the user experience specifically for mobile devices, and potentially provide additional features not available on the website. However, this option was ultimately deemed too time-consuming and costly to pursue at this time. Instead, we will focus on optimizing the website for mobile devices, which should provide a more immediate and cost-effective solution.*

## Assumptions

***Example:*** *Summary of Assumptions*

- *The proposed solution is technically feasible and can be implemented within the given timeframe and budget constraints.*
- *The proposed solution will have the desired impact on the problem and will not have any negative unintended consequences.*
- *All relevant stakeholders have been consulted and are in agreement with the proposed solution.*

## Risks

***Example:*** *It is important to carefully consider these potential technical risks and develop strategies to mitigate them, in order to ensure that the decision and its implementation are successful.*
- *There is a risk that the proposed solution may not be technically feasible, and could require significant additional development work to implement.*
- *There is a risk that implementing the proposed solution will require significant changes to the existing system, which could cause instability or downtime.*
- *There is a risk that the proposed solution will not be compatible with existing technologies or systems, which could impact its effectiveness.*
